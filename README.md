# Discord Bot Maker
This is a temporary name for the project until I think of something better (tell me if you have an idea)  

This is a simple app which allows you to create your own Discord bots to do anything you like!  

It has a simple prograaming language, custom made (scratch-like block coding coming soon!).  

## Example Code
Once you have created a command, you could do for example:
```
message.reply("Hello World! You said: " + message.content)
```

## Installation
1. Download the repository
2. Make sure you have: cargo, rust, node, npm installed
3. In the main directory, run `npm install`
4. You should then be able to run `npm run tauri dev`
